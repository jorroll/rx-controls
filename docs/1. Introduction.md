# rx-controls

The `rx-controls` package provides several javascript `FormControl` objects to make dealing with forms easier. The library can be used stand-alone via `rx-controls` or via one of the framework specific options.

```bash
# vanilla
yarn add rx-controls
# solidjs
npm install rx-controls-solid
# angular
yarn add rx-controls-angular
```

## Documentation for packages

Even if you plan on using one of the framework specific packages for rx-controls, you should start by reading this core documentation.

### Core Library

rx-controls introduces three basic objects for managing form state, as well as two key interfaces:

- [`FormControl`](#formcontrol)
- [`FormGroup`](#formgroup-and-formarray)
- [`FormArray`](#formgroup-and-formarray)
- [`AbstractControl`](#abstractcontrol-and-abstractcontrolcontainer)
- [`AbstractControlContainer`](#abstractcontrol-and-abstractcontrolcontainer)

#### FormControl

The most basic of these objects is a `FormControl`. A FormControl is intended to model a single input element of a form. For example, an `<input />` element or a `radio` button group. You can use a FormControl to save the value of the input, to track whether the input has been touched or not, to track if the input value has been changed or not, to track if the input has been submitted or not, to handle validation of the input and track errors, etc. The FormControl also provides a straightforward method of watching changes to the state of your input via an observable (RxJS) api. But the real power of FormControls comes from their composability with other controls such as `FormGroup` and `FormArray`.

Before we get ahead of ourselves, lets look at some simple FormControl operations. Here I'm displaying all of the FormControl options with their default values.

```ts
// at it's simplest
const control = new FormControl();

// or at it's most complex
const control = new FormControl("", {
  data: undefined,
  id: undefined,
  disabled: undefined,
  touched: undefined,
  dirty: undefined,
  readonly: undefined,
  submitted: undefined,
  pending: undefined,
  errors: null,
  validators: null,
});
```

If we want to set the value on our FormControl, we can:

```ts
control.setValue("Hi");
control.value; // "Hi"
```

We can also mark our FormControl as touched

```ts
control.markTouched(true);
control.touched; // true
control.markTouched(false); // you get the idea
```

We can manually add errors to our form control

```ts
control.errors; // null
control.valid; // true
control.setErrors({ required: true });
control.errors; // { required: true }
control.valid; // false
control.patchErrors({ tooLong: "must be less than 5 characters" });
control.errors; // { required: true, tooLong: "must be less than 5 characters" }
```

We can also add validation functions which will be run after every value change

```ts
control.value; // ""
control.errors; // null
control.setValidators([
  (args) =>
    typeof args.value === "string" && args.value.length > 0
      ? null
      : { required: true },
]);
control.value; // ""
control.errors; // { required: true }
control.setValue("Hi");
control.errors; // null
```

We also have the ability to observe any properties of the FormControl as well as changes to those properties

```ts
control.observe("errors"); // returns an rxjs Observable
control.observe("value").subscribe((value) => {
  // This emits immediately with the current control value.
  // It also emits whenever `control.value` changes. "value" emissions
  // happen *after* validation is performed, so you can safely check
  // whether or not the control is valid here.
});

control.observeChanges("value").subscribe((value) => {
  // Unlike FormControl#observe(), observeChanges doesn't emit immediately and instead
  // waits until the next change before emitting
});
```

We also have the ability to observe all events, including all state changes, to the FormControl. This isn't a feature you'll usually need, but when you do need it it's _incredibly_ helpful.

```ts
control.events
  .pipe(
    filter(isStateChangeEvent),
    filter((e) => e.source === "myCustomService")
  )
  .subscribe((event) => {
    // Here we can access the control's state changes, including
    // seeing exactly what properties changes.

    if ("value" in event.changes) {
      // do stuff
    }

    if ("invalid" in event.changes) {
      // do stuff
    }
  });
```

Every FormControl method accepts an optional options object one nifty option is the `meta` option which allows you to attach arbirary metadata to any change. This metadata is accessible via the emitted `IControlStateChangeEvent`.

```ts
control.setValue("", {
  meta: {
    message:
      "this-is-my-special-reset-and-should-be-ignored-by-my-custom-validation",
  },
});

control.events
  .pipe(
    filter(isValidationStartEvent),
    filter(
      (e) =>
        e.meta.message !==
        "this-is-my-special-reset-and-should-be-ignored-by-my-custom-validation"
    ),
    switchMap((e) => myCustomValidationService(e.value))
  )
  .subscribe((result) => {
    if (result.errors) {
      control.setErrors(result.errors, { source: "my-custom-validation" });
    } else {
      control.setErrors(null, { source: "my-custom-validation" });
    }
  });
```

We also introduced a few additional new concepts in the previous example.

#### validation events

You can see that controls emit special `ValidationStart` and `AsyncValidationStart` events. These allow you to create validation services that validate controls before any `observe("value")` Observables are triggered. `AsyncValidationStart` events are emitted after `ValidationStart` events. This allows an async validation service to see if the current value passed the synchronous validation when deciding what to do. Because FormControl events are emitted synchronously, the FormControl will not wait for async validation to complete before emitting the new value via `observe("value")` (or `observeChanges("value")`). However, your async validation service can synchronously mark the control as pending before proceeding with async validation. Then, any code observing the control's value can check to see if the control is pending when deciding to react (you could even buffer a `"value"` subscription until the control is not pending).

#### `source` option

Here we make use of another `IControlEventOption`, "source". The `source` option allows us to indicate the source of a change. At minimum, this allows us to see what the source of a change was on the emitted event, but we could also accomplish that with `meta`. Really, what source lets us do is tell the FormControl how to store various pieces of state. For example, `FormControl#setErrors()` will use the `source` option to partition the errors. If `source` is not provided, the default source is the control's `id` property (a `Symbol`). This allows different sources to set errors on the control without worrying about accidently deleting one another's errors. All of these internal error partitions are merged together into a single object for `FormControl#errors`.

#### Syncing controls with one another

The FormControl `events` observable describes all the events in the FormControl's life. And with this stream, we can sync one FormControl to another.

```ts
const a_control = new FormControl("Hi");
const b_control = new FormControl(null);

a_control.events.subscribe((e) => b_control.processEvent(e));

a_control.value; // "Hi"
b_control.value; // null
b_control.setValue(1);
b_control.value; // 1
a_control.value; // "Hi"
a_control.setValue("Huzza");
a_control.value; // "Huzza"
b_control.value; // "Huzza"
```

We can also sync two controls in both directions

```ts
const a_control = new FormControl("Hi");
const b_control = new FormControl(null);

concat(a_control.replayState(), a_control.events).subscribe((e) =>
  b_control.processEvent(e)
);

b_control.events.subscribe((e) => a_control.processEvent(e));

a_control.value; // "Hi"
b_control.value; // "Hi"

b_control.setValue("My name");
a_control.value; // "My name"
a_control.setValue("Is John");
b_control.value; // "Is John"
```

If we wanted, we could transform the events as they are passed back and forth between both controls. For example, this would allow a `FormControl<string>` to sync its value to a `FormControl<Date | null>` where valid strings are transformed into a `Date` object and invalid strings become `null`.

```ts
concat(a_control.replayState(), a_control.events)
  .pipe(
    filter(isStateChangeEvent),
    map((e) => {
      if ("value" in e.changes) {
        // IMPORTANT! Control events are immutable!
        return {
          ...e,
          changes: {
            ...e.changes,
            // for simplicity, lets assume the string is in the correct format
            value: new Date(e.changes.value),
            // `rawValue` will be discussed in the FormGroup / FormArray sections.
            // in the case of a FormControl, `value` is an alias for `rawValue`.
            rawValue: new Date(e.changes.rawValue),
          },
        };
      }

      return e;
    })
  )
  .subscribe((e) => b_control.processEvent(e));
```

In the above example, we've introduce another new method: `replayState()`. The control event api provides an easy way for us to save control state as an observable snapshot, which we can consume again at a later date.

```ts
const control = new FormControl(null);

const replay = control.replayState();

control.setValue("Hi");
control.value; // "Hi"
control.markTouched(true);
control.touched; // true

replay.subscribe((e) => control.processEvent(e));

control.value; // null
control.touched; // false
```

Because `replayState` just returns another state change observable, we can also filter / map / etc it's value. For example, if we only wanted to replay the "touched" state, we could remove all of the other changes from the state change event before processing it.

#### Immutability

With the exception of the `data` property on FormControls, all properties and events are immutable. This is not enforced by the library, but if you manually mutate stuff you're going to break things. If you are going to be manipulating control events often, a library like [`immr`](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) is probably recommended. If you use the build-in methods for making changes (e.g. `patchErrors()`), the immutability is handled for you.

This is BAD

```ts
// DO NOT DO THIS
control.value = 3;
```

```ts
// This is correct
control.setValue(3);
```

#### FormGroup and FormArray

`FormGroup` and `FormArray` are very similar. They both act as containers for other controls. FormGroup stores controls in an object format.

```ts
const control = new FormGroup({
  firstName: new FormControl(""),
  lastName: new FormControl(""),
  address: new FormGroup({
    street: new FormControl("123 Street"),
  }),
});

control.value; // { firstName: '', lastName: '', address: { street: '123 Street' } }
```

While FormArray stores controls in an array format

```ts
const control = new FormArray([
  new FormControl(1),
  new FormGroup({
    two: new FormControl(2),
  }),
]);

control.value; // [1, { two: 2 }]
```

FormGroup and FormArray both implement FormControl (though they don't `extend` it). The control containers add additional methods as befits them.

Some examples

```ts
const control = new FormGroup({
  firstName: new FormControl(""),
  lastName: new FormControl(""),
});

control.patchValue({
  firstName: "John",
});

control.value; // { firstName: "John", lastName: "" }
control.controls; // { firstName: FormControl<string>, lastName: FormControl<string> }

control.removeControl("lastName");
control.controls; // { firstName: FormControl<string> }

control.get("lastName"); // FormControl<string>

control.valid; // true
control.selfValid; // true
control.childValid; // true
control.childrenValid; // true

control.childTouched; // false
control.childrenTouched; // false
// etc
```

As with FormControls, you can observe the properties of the control containers. In this case, we can also drill down and observe child properties. This can be very useful. For example, we can subscribe to the value of a "firstName" child even if the control associated with the "firstName" key changes.

```ts
const control = new FormGroup({
  firstName: new FormControl(""),
  lastName: new FormControl(""),
});

control.observe("value").subscribe((v) => {
  /* ... */
});
control.observe("value", "firstName").subscribe((v) => {
  // here we are subscribing to the value of the "firstName" child control
  // if the "firstName" control is removed this will emit `undefined`
});
control.observeChanges("controls", "lastName", "touched").subscribe((v) => {
  // here we are subscribing to the touched status of the "lastName" child control
});
```

Of course, we can also subscribe to all the control's events. In the case of control containers, they will also emit the state changes for all of their children in addition to themselves (their state is dependent on the state of the children, after all).

```ts
formGroup.events.pipe(filter(isStateChangeEvent)).subscribe((e) => {
  if (e.childEvents?.firstName?.changes?.value === "Bob") {
    // do stuff
  }
});
```

Helpfully, you can also access all of the child control errors on a parent control container.

```ts
formGroup.selfErrors; // errors associated with the FormGroup itself
formGroup.childrenErrors; // errors associated with the FormGroup's children
formGroup.errors; // { ...formGroup.childrenErrors, ...formGroup.selfErrors }
```

#### AbstractControl and AbstractControlContainer

So far, I've been referring to FormControl as if it's the most basic control. In reality, every control (including `FormControl`) implements the `AbstractControl` interface. `FormGroup` and `FormArray` implement the `AbstractControlContainer` interface, which extends the `AbstractControl` interface. By implementing `AbstractControl` or `AbstractControlContainer` in a custom class, you should be able to create objects which integrate seemlessly with this library (not that implementing AbstractControl will be easy -- it probably won't be).

If you want to check if an object is an `AbstractControl` or `AbstractControlContainer`, do not use `instanceof`. Instead do:

```ts
AbstractControl.isControl(someValue);
AbstractControlContainer.isControlContainer(someValue);
```

Familiarizing yourself with the `AbstractControl` and `AbstractControlContainer` interfaces is highly recommended to see the entire API surface of this library.

View the source:

- [`AbstractControl`](../projects/rx-controls/src/lib/abstract-control/abstract-control.ts) (starting line 265 at time of writing)
- [`AbstractControlContainer`](../projects/rx-controls/src/lib/abstract-control-container/abstract-control-container.ts) (starting line 159 at time of writing)

#### Debugging

If you are trying to debug complex control events, you can make use of `AbstractControl.debugCallback`. If you provide a callback function, whenever a control is about to emit an event it will first pass that event to your callback function and call the function within the context of the control (i.e. the `this` of the function will be the control).

For example:

```ts
AbstractControl.debugCallback = function (event) {
  console.log(`Control ${this.id}`, event);
};
```

Additionally, control events provide a `debugPath` property which shows the "path" the event took before being emitted. Instead of me trying to explain what "path" means in this context, just try printing a control event to the console. Hopefully it'll be clear what the `debugPath` is showing you. Note, debug options may change in breaking ways outside of a major release. Do not rely on them for runtime behavior. If you have a runtime use-case for a debug option, open an issue.
